      "Transcribed text: I've had some indication that the audio on this iPad 6th generation device for videos is inadequate, not loud enough. So I'm going to run it, just this little test audio, through Movie Maker as I always run the videos through. But I'm going to try enhancing the volume. And then you can compare this with the other, well, just the one that appears in the roster right after it, having to do with controlling, remote controlling an antenna system. I will leave comments open. Please let me know what you think. Stan Jablisko signing off. Until next time, so long. Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs!\n"
